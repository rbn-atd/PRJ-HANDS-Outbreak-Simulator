HANDS plugin for disease outbreak simulation use case

The plugin also includes some data visualisation to contextualise simulation results.

This plugin provides strategies for human seeking agents with relevant characteristics to
an outbreak scenario.
The simulation models realistic populations with these characteristics with the support of
Synner, a synthetic data generator, to produce accurately distributed populations between each
type of characteristic.

The idea of the simulations is to:
1. Be able to provide some predictions on the performance of an existing population.
2. Use data visualisation to identify locations to prioritise response to.
3. Use average traversal cost data to identify groups of people to prioritise reponse to.
4. Update the population with these insights in mind and compare performance to the initial population.

This should provide organisations and governing bodies with a supportive tool to aid in improving
outbreak responses such as vaccine roll out, medical resource roll out and allocating health care professionals to operate
in certain locations.
